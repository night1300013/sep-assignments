1.Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
7 iterations, it needs to go from A all the way to G.

2. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
3 iterations, it first filters out A-D, then EF, finally get G.

3. Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.

4.Save the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence above as fibonnaci_recursive.rb. Compare the time it takes to run fib(20) between the iterative solution from the previous checkpoint and recursive solutions.
                user     system      total        real
fib iterative  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000006)
fib recursion  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000005)

5.Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
Linear search, since it's unsorted, binary search won't work. For going through million unsorted items, iterative is a good idea.

6.Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
Binary search, since it will take much more less time than linear search(log(n) vs n). I will use recursive since it is easier for coding.
